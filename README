LibreText
=========

LibreText generates text for typeface designers to test their typefaces with.

Pick a language, type in the characters your font has, click Generate, and
this tool generates text using words that only contain those characters.  

Installation
------------

Simply clone the git repository into a directory that is served by a PHP-enabled web server. 

$ cd /var/www/;
$ git clone https://github.com/garethsprice/libretext.git;
$ open "http://localhost/libretext";

History
-------

LibreText was started by Dave Crossland <dave@understandingfonts.com>
and Gareth Price <gareth@garethsprice.com> as a libre software replacement
for several proprietary typeface design text generator programs.
