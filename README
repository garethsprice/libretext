LibreText
=========

LibreText generates text for typeface designers to test their typefaces with.

Pick a language, type in the characters your font has, click Generate, and
this tool generates text using words that only contain those characters.  

History
-------

LibreText was started by Dave Crossland <dave@understandingfonts.com>
and Gareth Price <gareth@garethsprice.com> as a libre software replacement
for several proprietary typeface design text generator programs.
